    Problem 1
    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

    Hints:
    A simple solution to this involves sum, filter and mod.
-}

problem1 = sum [x | x <- [1..999], x `mod` 3 == 0 || x `mod` 5 == 0]
-- Alternatively:
--problem1 = sum $ filter (\x -> x `mod` 3 == 0 || x `mod` 5 == 0) [1..999]
--problem1 = sum [x | x <- [1..999], isDivByOneOf x [3, 5]]
           --where isDivByOneOf x = any (\n -> x `mod` n == 0)

{-
    Problem 4

    A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

    Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

-}
problem4 = maximum [x * y | x <- [111..999], y <- [111..999], isPalindromic (x * y)]
                   where isPalindromic n = (show n) == (reverse $ show n)

{-
    Problem 6

    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
    1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025

    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
-}
problem6 = squareOfSums - sumOfSquares
           where sumOfSquares = sum $ map (^ 2) range
                 squareOfSums = sum range ^ 2
                 range        = [1..100]

{-
    Problem 16

    2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.

    What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?
-}
problem16 = sum $ map digitToInt $ show $ 2 ^ 1000
