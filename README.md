## How to get started

The exercises are meant to be solved in a test-driven way. There are per-module test suites under `Tests/` and an `AllTests` module that contains all the tests.

Suggested order:

1. GettingStarted
1. Functions
1. PartialApplication
1. Recursion
1. RecursionSchemes
1. CreditCardNumberValidator
1. PatternMatching
1. HigherOrderFunctions
1. ProjectEuler
1. QuickCheckExamples
1. Vigenere

A simple way of running the tests locally is to use the command

    $ runhaskell Tests/<test name>.hs`

e.g. `runhaskell Tests/GettingStartedTests.hs`.

See `CheatSheet.hs` for examples of Haskell syntax and the use of some common
functions.
